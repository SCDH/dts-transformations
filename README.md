# DTS Transformations

[![Tests](https://github.com/SCDH/dts-transformations/actions/workflows/test.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/SCDH/dts-transformations/actions/workflows/test.yaml)
[![Create release](https://github.com/SCDH/dts-transformations/actions/workflows/deploy.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/SCDH/dts-transformations/actions/workflows/deploy.yaml)


This project provides XSLT stylesheets for those endpoints of
[Distributed Text Services
(DTS)](https://distributed-text-services.github.io/specifications/),
that can be implemented generically.

- **navigation** endpoint
- **document** endpoint

The other endpoints are not targeted by this project. But there are
[recommendations](#other-endpoints).

## Status of Implementation

Implemented version: [1.0rc1](https://distributed-text-services.github.io/specifications/versions/1.0rc1/)

Query parameters for the endpoints are supported through stylesheet
parameters:

| parameter   | [navigation](https://distributed-text-services.github.io/specifications/versions/1.0rc1/#uri-for-navigation-endpoint-requests) | [document](https://distributed-text-services.github.io/specifications/versions/1.0rc1/#query-parameters-2) |

## XSLT for Endpoints

### Navigation

The [`xsl/navigation.xsl`](xsl/navigation.xsl) XSLT package generates
the
[`dts:Navigation`](https://distributed-text-services.github.io/specifications/versions/1.0rc1/#scheme-for-navigation-endpoint-responses)
JSON-LD object as required by the navigation endpoint. Members are
generated by evaluating
[`tei:citeStructure`](https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-citeStructure.html)
elements in the processed TEI document.

`xsl/navigation.xsl` can either be applied on a TEI source document,
e.g. `test/matt.xml`

```shell
$SAXON_CMD -xsl:saxon-local.xml -xsl:xsl/navigation.xsl -s:test/matt.xml
```

... or it can be called with an initial template (the default initial
template `xsl:initial-template`) where the source URL can then be
passed as the `resource` stylesheet parameter:

```shell
$SAXON_CMD -xsl:saxon-local.xml -xsl:xsl/navigation.xsl -it resource=test/matt.xml
```

When a source document is processed, the `resource` stylesheet
parameter can be used to set the source's URI in multiple properties
of the JSON-LD output.

### Document

The [`xsl/document.xsl`](xsl/document.xsl) XSLT package implements the
either full or part-wise delivery of a TEI document.

Just as `xsl/navigation.xsl`, also `xsl/document.xsl` can be applied
on a source document (where the `resource` parameter can be used to
reset the resource identifier)

```shell
$SAXON_CMD -xsl:saxon-local.xml -xsl:xsl/document.xsl -s:test/matt.xml
```

... or it can be called with the default initial template:

```shell
$SAXON_CMD -xsl:saxon-local.xml -xsl:xsl/document.xsl -it resource=test/matt.xml
```


## Getting started

### Command Line

If you have Saxon HE at hand, simply use it as follows.

1. Download released zip packages of the project. They are available
   as [release assets](https://github.com/SCDH/dts-transformations/releases/).
   ```shell
   unzip dts-transformations-VERSION-package.zip
   ```
2. Setup the class path for Saxon:
   ```shell
   export SAXON_CMD="java -cp ... net.sf.saxon.Transform"
   ```
3. Transform:
   ```shell
   $SAXON_CMD -config:dts-transformations/saxon.he.xml -xsl:dts-transformations/xsl/navigation.xsl -s:YOUR_TEI.xml
   ```


### Oxygen Framework

You can install the transformations bundled in an Oxygen
framework. The framework works on top of the `TEI P5` framework and
its transformation scenarios support you well in writing cite
structure declarations with `<refsDecl>` and `<citeStructure>`
elements. The framework can simply be installed by putting the
following URL into the dialog box in **Help** > **Install new add-ons
...**.

```
https://scdh.github.io/dts-transformations/descriptor.xml
```

There is a detailed installation guide in the
[Wiki](https://github.com/SCDH/dts-transformations/wiki).

### Cloning

You can also clone this repo and set up and use its conveniant
[Tooling](https://github.com/scdh/tooling) like so:

Setup:

```shell
# git clone ...
cd dts-transformations
./mvnw package            # sets up tooling
```

Besides a wrapper script for Saxon-HE under `target/bin/xslt.sh`, this
also provides you with [Apache Jena
RIOT](https://jena.apache.org/documentation/io/) under
`target/bin/riot.sh` and the command line interface of [Titanium
JSON-LD](https://github.com/filip26/ld-cli) under `target/bin/ld-cli`.

Transforming:

```shell
target/bin/xslt.sh -config:saxon.he.xml -xsl:xsl/navigation.xsl -s:test/matt.xml
```

Other RDF serialization (e.g. expanded JSON-LD):

```shell
target/bin/xslt.sh -config:saxon.he.xml -xsl:xsl/navigation.xsl -s:test/matt.xml | target/bin/ld-cli expand -op
```


### Deployment

To make DTS endpoints, the XSL transformations from this package need
to be deployed on a web service. There are several options and we will
publish a PoC for a deployment in a micro service architecture very
soon.

## Customization

### Citation Trees

To add custom citation tree constructions not based on
`<citeStructure>`, you can add templates to the `citationTrees` mode
defined in [`xsl/tree.xsl`](xsl/tree.xsl). It is initiated on every
`refsDecl` and is first called on `self::refsDecl`. It runs in
shallow-skip mode.


### HTTP Status Codes

To get the HTTP status codes, that the DTS specs prescribe for certain
errors, the static parameters in [`xsl/errors.xsl`](xsl/errors.xsl)
can be used. They define error codes that a web service can catch and
then return HTTP status codes accordingly.

Please note, that the XSLT uses `<xsl:assert>` in some places, which
does not throw errors per default, but needs the XSLT processor
configured to do so. Saxon HE can be told by the [`-ea:on` command
line
switch](https://www.saxonica.com/documentation12/index.html#!using-xsl/commandline)
or by the [`/configration/xslt/@enableAssertions` configuration file
option](https://www.saxonica.com/documentation12/index.html#!configuration/configuration-file)
to enable assertions.


### mediaType

Processing of the `mediaType` parameter is a matter of post-processing
the result of applying [`xsl/document.xsl`](xsl/document.xsl). It is
thus is up to customization. There are several approaches:

1. **chaining** the output of the `xsl/document.xsl` to another
   transformation which evaluates the `mediaType` parameter
2. **importing** parts of `xsl/document.xsl` in an third stylesheet
   that processes `mediaType`
3. **compile time customization** of `xsl/document.xsl` through its
   static parameters which determine a `media-type-package`, its
   version, and how it is called for processing `mediaType`

The first option wins the award of straighforwardness, but may have a
downside: The source-document context of the nodes will probably be
lost during the post-processing phase. The other approaches can get
the full benefit from the nice feature, that the nodes returned by the
two `dts:cut-...#1` functions in
[`xsl/document.xsl`](xsl/document.xsl) are still in the context of the
source document (node identity). So you can probably use your
well-written stylesheets for getting HTML, plain text, LaTeX, etc,
even for parts of your documents.

For the third option, see the example `post-proc-(apply|call|fun).xsl`
packages in the [`test`](test) folder.

### URL Templates

URL templates, which are required for the output of the
[`dts:Resource`](https://distributed-text-services.github.io/specifications/versions/1.0rc1/#scheme-for-navigation-endpoint-responses)
LOD object, must of course be adaptable to specific project
needs.

The adaption can be done by providing an custom XSLT package to the
`xsl/navigation.xsl` through its static parameters
`url-template-package` and `url-template-package-version`. An
implementation must expose two functions:

```
dts:url-template-map-entries ($resource as ducument-node(), parameters as map(xs:string, item()*) as item()*
```

```
dts:navigation-url ($resource as ducument-node(), parameters as map(xs:string, item()*) as xs:anyURI?
```

They get the resource document and the query parameters for maximum
flexiblity. The first function must return a sequence of
`<xsl:map-entry>` elements.

The [`xsl/url-templates/`](xsl/url-templates/) folder offers different
implementations.


### Additional Metadata

`xsl/navigation.xsl` offers customization points for adding metadata
and other LOD properties to the member objects.

1. The mode `member-metadata` can be used to add additional elements
   to the intermediate `<dts:member>` elements. The mode es called for
   each of the source's nodes (forrests) selected by a
   `citeStructure/@match`. This mode does not contain any templates
   but the default `shallow-skip`isch ones.
2. The function `dts:member-metadata-json#1` can be used to access
   these additional elements in order to output additional LOD
   properties to the member objects.


### `@context`

The value of JSON-LD `@context` property can be configured through the
`context` parameters in `xsl/dts.xsl`.


### JSON-LD Serialization

The JSON-LD output has an asserted order where order matters: in
arrays. **The members array is in document order.**

The order of object properties does not carry any information and
there are no guarantees about it. So the `@context` property of the
root object may occur as the first or the last property or somewhere
in the middle.

Saxon's JSON serializer per default escapes slashes with
backslashes. If this matters, first think about [configuring the
serializer](https://www.saxonica.com/documentation12/index.html#!configuration/configuration-file/config-serialization):
There's a `escape-solidus` option.

## Other Endpoints

The **collection** endpoint is not targeted by this project. We
recommend to first extract an RDF-based knowledge graph from your set
of documents using
[xtriples-micro](https://github.com/scdh/xtriples-micro) and to then
use SPARQL and JSON-LD Framing for generating the collection objects
from it. We have documented this approach in the [xtriples-micro's
Wiki](https://github.com/SCDH/xtriples-micro/wiki). The **entry**
endpoint is more a task for a text editor.
